Create a Unit Test for a Simple Apex Class
Create a simple Apex class to test if a date is within a proper range, and if not, returns a date that occurs at the end of the month within the range. You'll copy the code for the class from the Get Ready for the Hands-on Challenge section. Then write unit tests that achieve 100% code coverage.
Create an Apex class:
Name: VerifyDate
Code: Copy from Get Ready for the Hands-on Challenge section above
Place the unit tests in a separate test class:
Name: TestVerifyDate
Goal: 100% code coverage
Run your test class at least once
