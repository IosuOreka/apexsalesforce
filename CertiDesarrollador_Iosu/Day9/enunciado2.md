Create a Unit Test for a Simple Apex Trigger
Create a simple Apex trigger which blocks inserts and updates to any contact with a last name of 'INVALIDNAME'. You'll copy the code for the class from the Get Ready for the Hands-on Challenge section. Then write unit tests that achieve 100% code coverage.
Create an Apex trigger on the Contact object
Name: RestrictContactByName
Code: Copy from Get Ready for the Hands-on Challenge section above
Place the unit tests in a separate test class
Name: TestRestrictContactByName
Goal: 100% test coverage
Run your test class at least once
