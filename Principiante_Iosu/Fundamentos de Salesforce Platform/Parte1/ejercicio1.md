Add a custom field to the Contact object
Many homebuyers who work with Dreamhouse Realty are prequalified for a home loan. Brokers need to know how much money their clients can borrow so they can show properties in the right price range. Add a Loan Amount field to the Contact object so brokers can record and see this information.

Note: To pass this challenge, you will create a new custom field (in addition to the one you made earlier in this unit, if you were following along).
